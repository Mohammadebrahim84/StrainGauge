The length of the rod before stretching is 2 meters, and after stretching, it changes by 0.002 meters. The gauge factor (G) for the strain gauge is 2.5.\n",

This signal goes through a series of devices—called a measurement chain—which process and display the measured value. To make sure the output correctly reflects the actual quantity, calibration is needed.\n",
    "Calibration is the process of establishing a clear relationship between the output signal and the measured value. Depending on the situation, it can be simple (e.g., using known weights) or complex and expensive (e.g., applying controlled forces using hydraulic systems on large structures). Regardless of the method, accurate calibration is essential to ensure measurement reliability and minimize uncertainty.\n",

    "The signal then passes through one or more signal-conditioning units (e.g., amplifiers), which prepare it for the output unit. The final output can be analog, digital, printed, or fed to a computer for further processing.\n",
    "The design of a measurement chain depends on several factors: the type and range of the measured variable, the required accuracy, and the desired format of the output. Some chains are permanent (e.g., in industrial applications), while others are temporarily assembled for specific tasks.\n",

    "Strain gauges are profoundly versatile geotechnical tools with very broad applications that help to ensure safety and productivity. They are especially prized for their precision, ease of installation, low cost, long operating life, and the need for very limited maintenance. It is exciting to consider the many future applications of strain gauges in fields such as aerospace, cable bridges, rail monitoring (for railroad systems), and measuring torque and power in a wide range of rotating equipment such as fans, generators, wheels and propellers.
